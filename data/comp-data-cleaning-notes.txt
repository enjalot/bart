Notes on data cleaning BART compensation files:

- Started with mgmtnopolice.csv and nonmgmt.csv
- Got rid of extraneous stats on right hand side of file
- Added Source column to track origin of each row: MNP = mgmtnopolice.csv and NM = nonmgmt.csv
- Concatenated both files in to bart-comp-all.csv

- Simple global search/replace on Titles:
    'Mgr.' 	=> 'Manager'
    'Mgr'  	=> 'Manager'
    'Sr'	=> 'Senior'
    'Grp'	=> 'Group'
    'Asst'	=> 'Assistant'
    'ACTO'	=> 'Assistant Chief Transportation Officer'
    'Engr'	=> 'Engineering'
    'Dev'	=> 'Development'
    'Sys'	=> 'Systems
    'Supv'	=> 'Supervisor'
    'Super'	=> 'Supervisor'
    'Auto'   => 'Automotive'
    'Dept'	=> 'Department'
    'Exec'	=> 'Executive'
    'Maint'	=> 'Maintenance'
    'Engineer'	=> 'Engineering'
    'Mech'	=> 'Mechanical'
    'Rep'	=> 'Representative'
    'Sect'	=> 'Section'
    # Skipped:   'Admin' could be 'Administrative' or 'Administrator' or 'Administration'
    'Equip'	=> 'Equipment'
    'Tec'	=> 'Technician'
    'Tech'	=> 'Technician'

- Did a full outer join of all titles with job_families.csv, manually filled in any missing entries in result.  Result of this manual scrubbing in job_families_all_scrubbed.csv

- Results in bart-comp-all.csv
